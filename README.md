# 🎵 Terrible Volume Slider - The Worst Music Control Ever

## 📖 Project Description

The **Terrible Volume Slider** is a demonstration of intentionally bad UX (User Experience) design principles. This website showcases what NOT to do when designing user interfaces, featuring a volume control system that only works randomly and music that never stops once started.

## 🎮 How to Use

### Volume Control

2. **Click the slider** - you'll get an error message
3. **Use the randomize button** - the ONLY way to change volume
4. **Watch random changes** - volume changes automatically every 10 seconds

### Music Player
1. **Click the rainbow button** - music starts playing
2. **Music plays forever** - you cannot stop it
3. **Volume is random** - controlled by the terrible system
4. **Enjoy the chaos** - this is intentionally frustrating

### Navigation
- **Header links** - jump to different sections
- **Responsive design** - works on mobile and desktop
- **Smooth scrolling** - between page sections

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This website intentionally violates good UX principles:

### ❌ What NOT to Do (Demonstrated Here)
- **Hide functionality** behind random systems
- **Prevent user control** of basic features
- **Create unpredictable behavior** in interfaces
- **Make simple tasks complicated**

### ✅ What TO Do Instead
- **Clear user controls** for all functions
- **Predictable behavior** and consistent interfaces
- **Simple, intuitive** user experiences
- **User empowerment** through good design

## 🔧 Customization

### Changing Music
Replace `Music/F_CK SWAG.mp3` with your own audio file

### Modifying Colors
Update CSS variables in `css/styles.css`:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #4a90e2;
  --secondary-color: #ff6b6b;
}
```

### Adjusting Animations
Modify timing in CSS animations:
```css
@keyframes animate {
  0% { transform: perspective(1000px) rotateY(360deg) rotateX(15deg); }
  100% { transform: perspective(1000px) rotateY(0deg) rotateX(15deg); }
}
```
